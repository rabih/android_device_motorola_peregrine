HOW-TO for building CyanogenMod
_______________________________

- First, follow http://source.android.com/source to figure out how to get your build environment running, etc
- Make a directory for your build source, then sync CyanogenMod: repo init -u git://github.com/CyanogenMod/android.git -b cm-11.0
- git clone https://github.com/Shabbypenguin/android_device_motorola_peregrine device/motorola/peregrine
- git clone https://github.com/Shabbypenguin/android_device_motorola_msm8226-common device/motorola/msm8226-common
- git clone https://github.com/Shabbypenguin/android_kernel_motorola_msm8226 kernel/motorola/msm8226
- That will give you my 3 repos you will need additional ones from CM github that can be found in device/motorola/peregrine/cm.dependencies
- Plug in your phone, and run the extract files script against a working cyanogenmod build
- Change directory to the top, and source the build environment setup: . build/envsetup.sh
- Use the command brunch peregrine, and wait as your meal cooks.
- It should output an update.zip in out/target/product/peregrine/... you've made CyanogenMod. Congratulations.
